# Tetris-EEG

This repository contains code to run an adaptation of Tetris that dynamically changes the game speed based on Machine Learning predictions of the user's current Arousal and Valence every 4 seconds. This project was originally built to run an experiment called EEGoFeedback: Dynamic Flow Maintenance through Real-time EEG Emotion Prediction.

```

## Initial Setup

Once you have set up your python environment, run
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Playing the game/Data Collection
Current tetris implementation only tested with Python 3.13.7

To play the game, set the current working directory to Tetris-EEG/tetris, then run main.py. Make sure that an Emotiv EPOC X headset is close by and powered on.

```zsh
cd tetris
python main.py
```
